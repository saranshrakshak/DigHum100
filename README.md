# DigHum100
Saransh's repo for UC Berkeley's Digital Humanities 100 Summer 2021 taught by Prof. Adam Anderson. 
Project completed by Saransh Rakshak for the course of Digital Humanities 100, Summer 2021 at UC Berkeley, taught by Dr.Adam Anderson.

Individual doctor identification numbers have been hidden from data structures to prevent use of this tool in 'Doctor Shopping', where individuals may seek out certain doctors who more frequently write opiate prescriptions.

For further questions, or for full access to the opiate distribution data including doctor identification numbers, please feel free to reach out to me at srakshak@berkeley.edu 

--------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this project was to analyze opiate prescription records in different area codes across the United States, and identify any relation between average income of an area code and patterns of prescriptions written by doctors in that area code.

Data for this project comes from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
